        </ul>
        <p>First of all, I chose to do programming because I enjoy coding. However, one of the main reasons I chose to start coding was because during the pandemic I realise that the world was shifting and was leading us into a world of technology. I wanted to be on the side that would usher in the new age of technology. </p>
